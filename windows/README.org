This directory contains minimal exe stuff for gofer on windows

[Thanks Sikander Tamboli for the compile]

gofer.exe of course needs to be on your path (or call with absolute path)

In addition you need to set the environment variable PUGOFER
to the path of the chosen prelude; eg
set PUGOFER=Z:/path/to/pusimple.pre
before calling gofer
